# Create a CyberArk credential (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-top-note](../includes/cc-preview-features-top-note.md)]

This feature allows users to create a Power Automate credential that retrieves CCP CyberArk secrets from vault during runtime.

[!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Availability

Currently, this feature isn't available for US Government Clouds.

## Prerequisites

### Set up your CyberArk Central Credential Provider (CCP)

If your CyberArk Central Credential Provider (CCP) isn't set up, complete the following actions:

1. Install the Central Credential Provider (CCP). Learn more at <https://docs.cyberark.com/credential-providers/latest/en/Content/CCP/CCP-Installation.htm>.
1. Ensure that your machines can communicate with the CyberArk server.
1. Allow https connections to contact the CCP AIMWebService.

### Create an application with client certification authentication from PVWA

A signed certificate enables the application authentication with a certificate serial number.

To add a signed certificate:

1. Sign-in to CyberArk’s Password Vault Web Access (PVWA).
1. From the left navigation, select the **Applications** tab and then select **Add Application**.

1. Provide the information in the Application window (at least a name) and select **Add**.
1. In the details of the application, select **Add** on the **Authentication** tab.
1. Select **Certificate serial number** and enter the value. Learn more in [Application authentication methods](https://docs.cyberark.com/credential-providers/Latest/en/Content/CP%20and%20ASCP/Application-Authentication-Methods-general.htm#ClientCert).

### Set up a CyberArk safe that contains their user accounts

(Optional) If you don’t have a safe yet, you can create a Safe from PVWA:

1. From the left navigation, select **Policies** and then select **Safes**.
1. Select **Create Safe**.
1. Enter a safe name and select **PasswordManager**.
1. Enter Safe members and Access then select **Create Safe**.

    From PVWA, you can then add your machine accounts.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also create accounts from PrivateArk client.

1. From the left navigation, select **Accounts** > **Add Account**.
1. Select **Windows** as system type.
1. Select the safe you created to store your robotic process automation (RPA) machine accounts.
1. Provide information about your account and select **Add**.

### Define application and credential provider as safe member

1. Add the Credential Provider user as a Safe Member with the following authorizations:

    - List accounts
    - Retrieve accounts
    - View Safe Members

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-machines/manage-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of manage permissions in CyberArk":::

1. Add the application as a Safe Member with the following authorizations:

    - Retrieve accounts

## Add a CyberArk application to machine / group

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> It isn't currently possible for users to associate a CyberArk application with machines or groups that are shared with other users.

If you want to run a desktop flow on a machine or a group using CyberArk credentials, you need to add your CyberArk application information in the Power Automate portal.

1. Sign-in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. From the left navigation, select **Machines**, and then select the machine or the group.
1. In the Machine details, select **Configure CyberArk**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-machines/configure-cyberark.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the connection using credentials.":::

1. Select **New application**.
1. Enter the app ID of the application you created from CyberArk PVWA.
1. Select the certificate, which stores the private and the public key of the certificate.
    - The allowed formats are .pfx or .p12 files.
    - The private key should be marked as exportable.
1. Enter the certificate file password that is used to open the certificate file.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The password is not stored. The certificate is opened and encrypted with the public key of the machine group so it is only readable from the registered machines.

1. Enter a description (optional) and then select **Save**.

## Create a CyberArk credential

Now that you complete all the prerequisites steps, you can create your CyberArk credentials.

1. From the left navigation, select **Credentials**.
1. Select **New credential**.
1. In the wizard, define a credential name and a small description and then select **Next**.
1. Select CyberArk CCP as the type of credential store.
1. If you already defined a CyberArk store, you can select it from the dropdown. Otherwise, select **Create new**.

    - **Display name**: Provide a name for your CyberArk store.
    - **Server address**: The server address is the Central Credential Provider URL. For example, `https://svc.skytap.com:8992`.
    - **Application Id**: To find the Application ID, open CyberArk PVWA (Password Vault Web Access) on a web browser and navigate to the Applications tab.
    - **Safe**: Populate the name of the safe displayed in CyberArk PVWA.
    - **Folder** (optional): Populate the folder name where your credentials are stored. By default, credentials are stored in the "Root" folder.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-machines/select-credential-store.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create new credential store.":::

1. In the last step of the wizard, you need to provide the information about the user account:

    - **Username**: Select a username from your text environment variables or create a new one by selecting new.
    - **Object name**: The object name corresponds to the CyberArk object name store in the CyberArk safe. This value is also called account name in PVWA.
  
## Use the credential in a desktop flow connection

Your credential is now created. You can use it in a desktop flow connection to [run desktop flows from cloud flows](trigger-desktop-flows.md).
